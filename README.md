# Q&A chatbot with RAG on PDFs using open source libraries 
Background:
Although commercially-available large language models (LLMs) are very powerful, there are often concerns about data privacy when utilizing these models. In this proof of concept study, I utilized open access libraries (Llama Index and open source LLM) to build a small chatbot that extracts answers from an uploaded PDF (retrieval augmented generation). 

Results:
I did some preliminary testing with Mistra-7b LLM and found decent performance with answering questions from a scientific paper. Testing with PDFs from other domains is ongoing.

Python libraries/tools: Llama Index, ðŸ¤— transformers, PyTorch.
